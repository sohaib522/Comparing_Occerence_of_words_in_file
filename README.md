This project is about calculating occurence of keywords in a file. For instance there is File A which contain keywords "Lorem" , "is" ,"dummy" and we have to find occurence of those  keywords in File B.
File Management library fsream is used to read data from two files.
Project contain two files Keyword which in above scenario is file A and Data which is File B is above scenario.
Linklist data structure to store read data from files.
Let's understand project's chronology
Data read fron two file "data" and "keyword" is stored in linkedlist objects obj and obj1.
The two linklist objects are then campared.
In this way occurence of keywords is calculated and display on screen.
